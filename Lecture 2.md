<h3> Bags of Words </h3>

* Bags of words is a simple representation of text data in NLP. 
* The idea is to convert a text document into a numerical vector by counting the occurrences of words in the document.
* Each unique word in the corpus is assigned a unique index and a document is represented as a vector of the word count values.
* This representation ignores the order of words and the context in which they appear.
* Bags of words is commonly used as a preprocessing step for various NLP tasks, including text classification, clustering, and information retrieval, but it has limited ability to capture the meaning of words and the relationships between words.
