<h3> Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) </h3>

* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to process sequential data, such as text, speech, or time series data. 
* They have a hidden state that is updated at each time step based on both the current input and the previous hidden state, allowing them to maintain information about the context of the input sequence.
* The basic idea behind RNNs is to allow information to flow through the network across time steps.
* At each time step, the hidden state is updated based on the current input and the previous hidden state.
* This allows the network to maintain information about the context of the input sequence and use that information to make predictions about future inputs.
