## Lesson 4

Humans communicate complex ideas by composing words together into bigger units to convey complex meanings. A model needs to understand sentence structure in order to be able to interpret language correctly

<h3> Phase Structure Grammar </h3>

* Phrase structure refers to the way words and phrases are organized in a sentence to form a syntactic structure. 
* It includes the rules for combining words into larger units, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and adjective phrases, which then combine to form the sentence as a whole. 
* In linguistic theory, phrase structure is represented using tree diagrams that show the hierarchical relationship between the constituent elements of a sentence.
* In PSG, a sentence is represented as a tree structure, with the root node representing the sentence as a whole, and other nodes representing smaller units, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and adjective phrases. 
* The rules of PSG specify how these phrases can be combined to form a sentence, and how the constituent elements of a phrase are related to each other.

<h3> Dependency Grammar </h3>

* Dependency Grammar is a type of grammar that describes the relationships between words in a sentence. 
* Unlike phrase structure grammar, which focuses on grouping words into constituents, dependency grammar focuses on the relationships between individual words and how they depend on each other to form the sentence as a whole.
* In a dependency grammar, each word in a sentence is treated as a node in a graph, with directed edges representing the relationships between words.
* The relationships are typically labeled with grammatical relations, such as subject, object, or modifier. 
* The result is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the relationships between words in a sentence.

Dependency grammar has several advantages over phrase structure grammar, including its ability to handle complex sentence structures and its simplicity in modeling linguistic phenomena. Dependency grammar is widely used in NLP applications, such as parsing and information extraction, and is particularly useful for languages with free word order, where the relationships between words are more important than their linear order.
