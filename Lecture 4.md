## Lesson 4

Humans communicate complex ideas by composing words together into bigger units to convey complex meanings. A model needs to understand sentence structure in order to be able to interpret language correctly

<h3> Phase Structure </h3>

* Phrase structure refers to the way words and phrases are organized in a sentence to form a syntactic structure. 
* It includes the rules for combining words into larger units, such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and adjective phrases, which then combine to form the sentence as a whole. 
* In linguistic theory, phrase structure is represented using tree diagrams that show the hierarchical relationship between the constituent elements of a sentence.
