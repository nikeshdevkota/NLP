## Lesson 6

<h3> Perplexity </h3> 
* Perplexity is a measure of the quality of a language model. 
* It is used to quantify how well the model predicts a given text.
* It is calculated as the exponential of the average negative log-likelihood of the words in the text.
* Perplexity is expressed as a number, and the lower the perplexity score, the better the model is at predicting the text.
* For example, if a model assigns a high probability to the words in a text, then the perplexity score will be low.
* If two models are trained on the same data, the model with the lower perplexity score is considered to be a better fit for the data.
