<h3> Attention </h3>

Attention mechanism in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to enable a model to selectively focus 
on specific parts of the input sequence when processing it. The goal of attention is to improve the quality of the output by
giving the model the ability to weigh the importance of each part of the input sequence when generating the output.
