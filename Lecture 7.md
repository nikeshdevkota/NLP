## Lesson 7

<h3> Machine Translation </h3>

* Machine Translation is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another. 
* It is an important area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that has applications in a variety of domains, including e-commerce, information retrieval, and customer support.
* Machine translation has been a challenging problem for many years, and there have been many approaches proposed over the years, including rule-based methods, statistical methods, and neural network-based methods.
* The most recent advances in machine translation have been achieved using deep neural networks, specifically the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention. 
* Seq2Seq models consist of an encoder that processes the input sequence, and a decoder that generates the output sequence. 
* The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence, depending on what is most relevant for generating the next word in the output sequence.

<h3> Statistical Machine Translation </h3>

* Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is an approach to machine translation that relies on statistical models to translate text from one language to another. 
* It is based on the idea that large amounts of bilingual text can be used to train statistical models to predict the best translation for a given source sentence.
* SMT uses a phrase-based approach, where the source sentence is first segmented into phrases, and then the phrases are translated individually, taking into account the context of the surrounding phrases. 
* This allows SMT to handle word reordering and other linguistic phenomena that are characteristic of many language pairs.
* SMT models are trained using large bilingual corpora, where the model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target sentences given the source sentences. 
* The models can also be fine-tuned using additional data and methods, such as discriminative training, to improve the translation quality.
* However, it is now being surpassed by more recent approaches, such as neural machine translation, that are based on deep neural networks.
