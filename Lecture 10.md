<h3> Byte Pair Encoding Algorithms </h3>

The BPE algorithm proceeds as follows:

* Initialize the vocabulary with all of the single-byte characters in the text.

* Compute the frequency of all pairs of adjacent bytes in the text.

* Find the most frequent byte pair in the text, and add it to the vocabulary as a single, unused byte.

* Replace all occurrences of the most frequent byte pair in the text with the new byte.

* Repeat steps 2-4 until a predetermined number of iterations have been completed, or until the desired level of compression has been achieved.

At each iteration of the algorithm, the most frequently occurring pair of bytes is replaced with a single, unused byte, which allows the text to be compressed further. This process continues until the desired level of compression has been achieved, or until the algorithm has reached a predetermined number of iterations.BPE has been shown to be a highly effective compression algorithm for natural language text, and is widely used in NLP tasks such as text generation and machine translation. It has also been used as a pre-processing step in deep learning models for tasks such as language modeling and sentiment analysis, where it can help to reduce the size of the input data and improve the performance of the model.
