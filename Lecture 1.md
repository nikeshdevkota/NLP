## Lesson 1

<h3>Word Vector</h3> 
* Word vectors are mathematical representations of words used in NLP tasks. 
* They capture the semantic meaning of words by mapping each word to a high-dimensional vector in a continuous vector space, based on the context in which the word appears. 
* Similar words are mapped to vectors that are close together in the vector space, while dissimilar words are farther apart. 
* Word vectors are used in various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, etc.
